# Onereach.ai Project Rules

## Constitutional Documents

These documents are the source of truth for project planning and must be kept current:

### PUNCH-LIST.md
- **Purpose**: Master list of bugs, fixes, and small features
- **When to update**: 
  - After fixing any bug (mark complete, move to "Recently Completed")
  - When discovering new issues (add to appropriate priority section)
  - When completing features (mark complete with version number)
- **Before starting work**: Check if the task is already tracked here

### ROADMAP.md  
- **Purpose**: Strategic product roadmap for all app products
- **When to update**:
  - After completing major features (update status)
  - When product direction changes (update roadmap items)
  - Quarterly review of timeline accuracy
- **Products covered**: GSX Create, Video Editor, Spaces, Clipboard Manager, Smart Export, IDW Hub, AI Agents, Budget Manager, App Health

## Development Workflow

### Before Making Changes
1. Check PUNCH-LIST.md for related known issues
2. Check ROADMAP.md for strategic context
3. Understand which product area is affected

### After Completing Work
1. Update PUNCH-LIST.md:
   - Mark completed items with [x]
   - Move to "Recently Completed" section with version
   - Add any new issues discovered
2. Update ROADMAP.md if:
   - Major feature completed
   - Timeline needs adjustment
   - New capability added

### Versioning
- Current version tracked in package.json
- Use semantic versioning: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
- Reference version in PUNCH-LIST.md completions

## Code Conventions

### File Organization
- Main products: Individual HTML files (aider-ui.html, video-editor.html, etc.)
- Backend logic: Corresponding JS files
- Preload scripts: preload-*.js for IPC bridges
- Documentation: Markdown files in root

### Key Files by Product
- **GSX Create**: aider-ui.html, aider-bridge-client.js, app-manager-agent.js
- **Video Editor**: video-editor.html, video-editor.js, video-editor-app.js
- **Spaces**: spaces-api.js, clipboard-storage-v2.js
- **Release**: scripts/release-master.sh (hardened with checksum verification)

### State Persistence
- Use localStorage for UI state (positions, preferences)
- Use Spaces API for content storage
- Save state on beforeunload for graceful shutdown

## Release Process

Use `npm run release` which runs `scripts/release-master.sh`:
1. Prompts for version bump
2. Builds for ARM64 and x64
3. Generates verified checksums from actual files
4. Creates latest-mac.yml with correct checksums
5. Publishes to GitHub releases

**Never use electron-builder's generated checksums directly** - always regenerate from built files.

## Known Constraints

- Notarization not yet implemented (users must bypass Gatekeeper)
- Windows signing not implemented
- TypeScript migration incomplete (only aider-bridge-client.ts)
- 12+ preload scripts (consolidation needed)

## Communication

- Don't ask about GitHub token - it's configured and working
- Reference file paths when discussing changes
- Update constitutional documents as part of completing work
